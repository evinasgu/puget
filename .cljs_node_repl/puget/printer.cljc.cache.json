The following\n  options are available to control the printer:\n\n  #### General Rendering\n\n  `:width`\n\n  Number of characters to try to wrap pretty-printed forms at.\n\n  `:print-meta`\n\n  If true, metadata will be printed before values. Defaults to the value of\n  `*print-meta*` if unset.\n\n  #### Collection Options\n\n  `:sort-keys`\n\n  Print maps and sets with ordered keys. If true, the pretty printer will sort\n  all unordered collections before printing. If a number, counted collections\n  will be sorted if they are smaller than the given size. Otherwise,\n  collections are printed in their natural sort order. Sorted collections are\n  always printed in their natural sort order.\n\n  `:map-delimiter`\n\n  The text placed between key-value pairs in a map.\n\n  `:map-coll-separator`\n\n  The text placed between a map key and a collection value. The keyword :line\n  will cause line breaks if the whole map does not fit on a single line.\n\n  `:namespace-maps`\n\n  Extract common keyword namespaces from maps using the namespace map literal\n  syntax. See `*print-namespace-maps*`.\n\n  `:seq-limit`\n\n  If set to a positive number, then lists will only render at most the first n\n  elements. This can help prevent unintentional realization of infinite lazy\n  sequences.\n\n  #### Color Options\n\n  `:print-color`\n\n  When true, ouptut colored text from print functions.\n\n  `:color-markup`\n\n  :ansi for ANSI color text (the default),\n  :html-inline for inline-styled html,\n  :html-classes to use the names of the keys in the :color-scheme map\n  as class names for spans so styling can be specified via CSS.\n\n  `:color-scheme`\n\n  Map of syntax element keywords to color codes.\n\n  #### Type Handling\n\n  `:print-handlers`\n\n  A lookup function which will return a rendering function for a given class\n  type. This will be tried before the built-in type logic. See the\n  `puget.dispatch` namespace for some helpful constructors. The returned\n  function should accept the current printer and the value to be rendered,\n  returning a format document.\n\n  `:print-fallback`\n\n  Keyword argument specifying how to format unknown values. Puget supports a few\n  different options:\n\n  - `:pretty` renders values with the default colored representation.\n  - `:print` defers to the standard print method by rendering unknown values\n    using `pr-str`.\n  - `:error` will throw an exception when types with no defined handler are\n    encountered.\n  - A function value will be called with the current printer options and the\n    unknown value and is expected to return a formatting document representing\n    it.\n  "]
